# fredis
fredis is a demonstration project that illustrates how to sink streaming events into Redis using Apache Flink.

# Overview
This project provides an example implementation of integrating Apache Flink with Redis, showcasing how streaming data can be processed and stored in Redis efficiently.

# Features
	•	Apache Flink Integration: Demonstrates the use of Apache Flink for stream processing.
	•	Redis Sink Implementation: Provides an example of how to sink processed streaming data into Redis.
	
# Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:
	•	Java Development Kit (JDK): Version 8 or higher.
	•	Apache Maven: For building and managing project dependencies.
	•	Apache Flink: Set up and running.

cd fredis
Build the Project:
Use Maven to build the project:
mvn clean package
Run the Flink Job:
Submit the Flink job to your Flink cluster. Replace <FLINK_HOME> with your Flink installation directory:
<FLINK_HOME>/bin/flink run -c org.mv.os.fredis.YourFlinkJobTarget ./target/fredis-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
Ensure that the class path org.mv.os.fredis.YourFlinkJobTarget matches the main class of your Flink job.

# Project Structure
